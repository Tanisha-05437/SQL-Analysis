# SQL-Analysis
This presentation showcases a detailed data analysis project on the Adidas sales dataset using SQL. The primary aim is to leverage SQL queries to extract key business insights, identify sales patterns, and generate actionable recommendations to drive Adidas' business performance.

The project involves working with raw sales data, performing data cleaning, and creating structured tables to enable efficient analysis. Through SQL queries, we explored critical aspects such as best-selling and least-selling products, retailer-wise performance, sales trends over different time periods, and profit distribution across various sales methods.

By digging into these insights, we aim to support Adidas' strategic decision-making, helping the brand optimize its product portfolio, enhance channel profitability, and improve regional marketing strategies.
